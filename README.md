# Stop_Sign_Identification

This web app identifies if a stop sign is in the image or not. Only two classification: stop sign or no stop sign.

Project Tasks
Your job is to load the training images, create features, and train the model. You will then deploy the model to Code Engine so your manager can upload an image of a stop sign and your image classifier will classify the image and tell them to what accuracy it predicts it is correct.

1. Gather and upload data
2. Train the classifier
3. Deploy the Model

This project was part of the Computer Vision Course in the IBM AI Engineering Specialization (Coursera)

1. First I followed the template that was provided, which was in PyTorch.
2. I rewrote and experimented with the code in Tensorflow/Keras.
3. The deployed app is with the model created with Tensorflow/Keras.
